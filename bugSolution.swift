The provided code is correct in its behavior; it doesn't demonstrate an error, but rather illustrates a key aspect of Swift.  To modify the original array, you can use `enumerated()` and a for loop for in-place changes:

```swift
var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for (index, number) in numbers.enumerated() {
    numbers[index] *= 2
}

print(numbers) // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

Alternatively, you can use the `map` method and assign the result back to the original variable if you want to change the original array in place:

```swift
numbers = numbers.map { $0 * 2 }
print(numbers) // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
This approach creates a new array with doubled values and then assigns it back to `numbers`.  Choosing between these approaches depends on the desired outcome and coding style preference.
